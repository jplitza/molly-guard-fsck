This little script can be used together with molly-guard, a software that
executes hooks before shutting down or rebooting a Linux machine.

When copied to /etc/molly-guard/run.d, it will check if any ext-filesystem
is scheduled to be checked at the next boot. This would make the boot last
longer and thus may result in a longer downtime. Thus it then suggests to
manually check those filesystems beforehand.
